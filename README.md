## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

### Getting Started with ChatWeb

Follow these steps to set up and run ChatWeb:

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/spark-engine-ai/ChatWeb.git
   ```

2. **Set Up the Python Environment:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher. Create and activate an environment:
   ```
   conda create -n ChatWeb_env python=3.9 -y
   conda activate ChatWeb_env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the `ChatWeb` directory and install required packages:
   ```
   cd ChatWeb
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set OpenAI API Key:** Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. Replace `"your_OpenAI_API_key"` with
  your actual API key. Remember that this environment variable is session-specific, so you need to set it again if you
  open a new terminal session.
  On Unix/Linux:

  ```
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_OpenAI_API_key"
  ```

  On Windows:

  ```
  $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_OpenAI_API_key"
  ```

5. **Build Your Application:** Use the following command to initiate the building of your application,
  replacing `[description_of_your_idea]` with your idea's description and `[project_name]` with your desired project
  name:
  On Unix/Linux:

  ```
  python3 run.py --task "[description_of_your_idea]" --name "[project_name]"
  ```

  On Windows:

  ```
  python run.py --task "[description_of_your_idea]" --name "[project_name]"
  ```

6. **Run Your Application:**
   Access your project in the `ProjectOutput` directory. Run your application with:
   ```
   cd ProjectOutput/<project_name>_timestamp
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
