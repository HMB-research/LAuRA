According to the new user's task and our webapplication designs listed below: 

Task: "A marketing agency website that uses a aquagreen theme with subtle gradients and the header navbar should change the components like tabs which include an about us tab and a contact form tab and a home tab with different cool template sections".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " Next JS Tyepscript with Tailwind"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable webapplication with multiple files implemented via  Next JS Tyepscript with Tailwind. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The webapplication should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will be put inside the components folder. Keep in mind the pages/index.tsx file is already available and imports components/main.tsx so you do not have to make the index file.

You will first lay out the names of the core functions as well as list as many components that will be necessary, and also comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file with complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file to first import the other files that you will make. The "main" file is where all the components link to

Please note that the code should be fully functional, with no comments in the files and all components should have a highly detailed responsive UI design using tailwind, next js and typescript using lorem ipsum filler content unless specified.

Ensure to implement all functions and you must use things like border radius, subtle box shadows, borders, gradients etc. to build beautiful UI.
