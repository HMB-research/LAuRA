To create a sleek marketing agency website with subtle background gradients, unique sections, and a header navbar that changes components like tabs, we will use Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. We will start by creating the necessary components and then import them into the main file.

First, let's create the "Header" component. This component will contain the navbar with the tabs.

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const Header: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <header className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500">
      <nav className="flex items-center justify-between px-4 py-2">
        <div className="text-white font-bold text-lg">Logo</div>
        <div className="flex space-x-4">
          <a href="#" className="text-white hover:text-gray-200">Home</a>
          <a href="#" className="text-white hover:text-gray-200">About Us</a>
          <a href="#" className="text-white hover:text-gray-200">Contact</a>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
};

export default Header;
```

Next, let's create the "Home" component. This component will display the content for the Home tab.

components/Home.tsx

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <section className="bg-gray-100 py-8">
      <div className="container mx-auto">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to our Marketing Agency</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-700">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed euismod, nunc ac aliquam ultrices, mi urna lacinia arcu, vitae tincidunt dolor enim a metus.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

Now, let's create the "About" component. This component will display the content for the About Us tab.

components/About.tsx

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const About: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <section className="bg-white py-8">
      <div className="container mx-auto">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Us</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed euismod, nunc ac aliquam ultrices, mi urna lacinia arcu, vitae tincidunt dolor enim a metus.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
};

export default About;
```

Lastly, let's create the "Contact" component. This component will display the content for the Contact tab.

components/Contact.tsx

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const Contact: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <section className="bg-gray-100 py-8">
      <div className="container mx-auto">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Contact Us</h2>
        <form className="max-w-md mx-auto">
          <div className="mb-4">
            <label htmlFor="name" className="block text-gray-700 font-bold mb-2">Name</label>
            <input type="text" id="name" className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md px-4 py-2 w-full" />
          </div>
          <div className="mb-4">
            <label htmlFor="email" className="block text-gray-700 font-bold mb-2">Email</label>
            <input type="email" id="email" className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md px-4 py-2 w-full" />
          </div>
          <div className="mb-4">
            <label htmlFor="message" className="block text-gray-700 font-bold mb-2">Message</label>
            <textarea id="message" className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md px-4 py-2 w-full" rows={4}></textarea>
          </div>
          <button type="submit" className="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded-md">Submit</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
};

export default Contact;
```

Now, let's create the main file that imports and renders these components.

components/main.tsx

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';
import Contact from './Contact';

const Main: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <div className="container mx-auto">
        <div className="mt-8">
          <Home />
          <About />
          <Contact />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Main;
```

Finally, we need to update the pages/index.tsx file to import and render the Main component.

pages/index.tsx

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Main from '../components/Main';

const HomePage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Main />
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

With these files in place, you can now run the Next.js development server and see the marketing agency website with the desired features.

Please note that you may need to install the necessary dependencies, such as Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and configure them properly for the project to work.
